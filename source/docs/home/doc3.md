## Can I request updates?

Yes! We are always looking for new suggestions, improvements, and features for our documentation.

### Discord

If you prefer to use [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/NbqBQbaejS) to help us you can! Join our server and request some content!

## I found a Bug!

To report a bug or error with some of our code/documentation then please [submit an issue](https://github.com/DeepWebDevelopers/discord-bot-guide/issues). Keep in mind this only applies if it's a problem on **Our** end. This is not a place to get **Help** with code. That can be done in our discord server.
