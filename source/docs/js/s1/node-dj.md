# Installing Node | Windows

Before we can jump into the fun parts we must install the necessary technologies.

## What is node js? | Windows nav

> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.
>
> Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications using Node.js to a great extent.

You can learn more about [nodejs here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/nodejs_introduction.htm) or on the official site [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

First we will install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/). If your using windows to develop then this is very simple. Just go to the website and run the `exe` file.

:::caution

You need to have the lasted version of Nodejs installed. _Anything below 12.0 will not work._ Discord.js v12 requires Node 12.0 or higher to function properly.

:::

To check if you have node installed on your computer run

```
node -v
```

in your terminal. We also recommend downloading this [windows terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) as it is better than normal `cmd` for most cases.

If everything went well then you should see:

### Installing Discordjs

Now that you have Node install we can install Discord Js. To start this project we must create a folder to store all our files. This

Navigate to a place on your computer where you want to store and have easy access to the bot. Now create a new folder like normal. _(Or pro users can do `mkdir project-name`)_. Next, whatever name you inputted for the _project name_ you will run the command: `cd project-name`. For this tutorial, we will be using `discord-bot` as our project name.

### Final steps

Now that we have our project folder set up you will want to open your text editor. This is the place where you will edit and test your code. For this tutorial, I will be using [Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). It's a personal favorite and was created by Microsoft.

To launch vs-code easily run `code .` in your terminal. Next, we will set-up our development environment. Run `npm init` in the terminal. This command will ask you a few questions about your project. _If your not sure about something just hit enter to skip it._

:::

:::tip You can specify an optional title

Want to get started without being asked questions? Simply run `npm init -y`. This command will skip all the questions. You can edit them later in the package.json file.

:::

Now we are ready to install Discord.js. In the terminal run, `npm install discord.js`.

If everything went well you should something similar to this. You

And now we're done! Soon we will be righting our first command.

### Installing a linter

> Linters help you get more productive and save you time and money. They drive your team to better decisions (those oriented by data) and share ownership over the quality.

While it's not required, depending on how you set up your project it can be very helpful. Read more about [Linters](https://sourcelevel.io/blog/what-is-a-linter-and-why-your-team-should-use-it) here.

Hello, my fellow Linux user. If you're developing on Linux I will assume you are comfortable with the terminal. As there are many different options in Linux I will only go over the basics of terminal commands.
