Welcome! My name is PraveshK, and I will be guiding you through how to write a Discord Bot in Typescript! However, please read the section below.

## Important

Although you may want to write some really cool Discord bots, which of course, shouldn't stop you from learning how to write one in Typescript, I highly recommend you understand the basics of typescript. That includes basic typing of variables, parameters, etc. What interfaces, types, classes (public, private, readonly) are. If you think you are ready to go, check out the rest of this guide! If you need a place to start, check out this series by [NetNinja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pZmKW9-I_k&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI). Highly informative and easy to follow.

Alright, lets begin!
