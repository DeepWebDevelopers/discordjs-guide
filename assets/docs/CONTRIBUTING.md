## Working on it

We are always looking for **free** help. If you wish to contribute to the documentation you can clone our Github repo and make your changes. There are a lot of branches but only clone the alpha branch as it has the most up-to-date code. 

After editing the code you can make a pull request with your changes and they will be reviewed. If everything is good your changes will be pulled into the main branch.
